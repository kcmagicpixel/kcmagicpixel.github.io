**CANCELED** due to another blizzard. Stay safe and see you all when this winter nightmare ends!<!--more--> A new month is here and with it a fresh set of weekly meetups. This week we have **MBTL** and **GGST**! As a note, our schedule is changing slightly for March only, and we'll be running the second Runback of the month on the **4th** Saturday (the 22nd) instead of the 3rd.

As always, in addition to the brackets listed, casuals are welcome for any game all night if setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! 

## Fee and Schedule

Doors open at 7pm, please pay your $5 venue fee on arrival. The venue fee is paid to Larry's Game Store directly, either in-person while the shop is open, or on the [LGS website](https://www.larrysgamestore.com/products/kc-magic-pixel-5) after hours. This is what allows us to continue using the space, so please make sure you've paid before you leave!

We will be playing in the shop's event space, which is two doors to the left of the shop itself. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. The event schedule is detailed in the Events section of the sidebar, and is also always listed on the [Magic Pixel Events](https://kcmagicpixel.com/events/) page.

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social
