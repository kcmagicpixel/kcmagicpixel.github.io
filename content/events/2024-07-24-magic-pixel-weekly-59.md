EVO recovery edition. Come and celebrate your victories! Or, if you weren't so victorious, come and celebrate OoeyGooey's instead! We'll be taking it easy with just two brackets tonight, with **TEKKEN 8** at 8pm and **UNI2** at 9pm. For Tekken, Lidia **will** be legal to play!

As always, in addition to the brackets listed, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! 

## Fee and Schedule

Doors open at 7pm, please pay your $5 venue fee on arrival. The venue fee is paid to Larry's Game Store directly, either in-person while the shop is open, or on the [LGS website](https://www.larrysgamestore.com/products/kc-magic-pixel-5) after hours. This is what allows us to continue using the space, so please make sure you've paid before you leave!

We will be playing in the shop's event space, which is two doors to the left of the shop itself. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. The event schedule is detailed in the Events section of the sidebar, and is also always listed on the [Magic Pixel Events](https://kcmagicpixel.com/events/) page.

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social

Come check out the [discord](https://discord.gg/jkmn6CVrrQ) to be a part of the future of the Magic Pixel Weekly, and get in on our Sunday night casuals event. Keep an eye on our [start.gg hub](https://www.start.gg/hub/magic-pixel) for future events too, as well as [kcmagicpixel.com](https://kcmagicpixel.com) for more of what's going on in the KC scene!
