For the 5th Tuesday of the month, we have a free-for-all! Bring whatever you want to play, and get some games all night long! We also have some one-off brackets for **KOFXV** and **Ultra Street Fighter IV**. If you are showing up with a setup, make sure to let others know in our <code>#community-organizing</code> discord channel. See y'all there!<!--more-->

<!--As always, in addition to the brackets listed, casuals are welcome for any game all night if setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! -->

## Fee and Schedule

Doors open at 7pm, please pay your $5 venue fee on arrival. The venue fee is paid to Larry's Game Store directly, either in-person while the shop is open, or on the [LGS website](https://www.larrysgamestore.com/products/kc-magic-pixel-5) after hours. This is what allows us to continue using the space, so please make sure you've paid before you leave!

We will be playing in the shop's event space, which is two doors to the left of the shop itself. Any game entry fees are collected by that game's TO, are **CASH ONLY**, and will be paid out as prizes. The event schedule is detailed in the Events section of the sidebar, and is also always listed on the [Magic Pixel Events](https://kcmagicpixel.com/events/) page.

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social
