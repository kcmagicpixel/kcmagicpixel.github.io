I'm hosting a Type Lumina bracket to raise money for Our Spot KC!

# What
Homelessness and housing instability affect 1 in 4 LGBTQ young people nationwide. Our Spot KC provides relief here in our community through their transitional housing programs, financial assistance, and support groups.

# How
Instead of paying $5 into a prize pool, make a donation to [Our Spot KC](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/our-spot-kc/justin-stout-1) when you register. This donation page tracks how much money we raise, but all funds go directly to Our Spot KC. If we raise at least $80 (e.g. 16 entrants x $5/per), TWO donors will match the amount raised!

# Also
- Donations are immediate and non-refundable.
- This is a voluntary donation, you may donate more or less.
- Donor matching will kick in based on whether the tracking page reaches $80.
